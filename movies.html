                <h3>Bring her back</h3>
                <p>Bring Her Back (2025) is a horror-drama about two foster siblings placed with a grieving woman who
                    secretly uses occult rituals to bring back her dead daughter—forcing the children to fight for
                    survival.</p>
                <h3>review:     7.45/10</h3>
                <p>Bring Her Back is really creepy in a slow, unsettling way. Sally Hawkins is amazing she feels caring
                    one moment and terrifying the next. The sibling story adds real heart, which makes the scary parts
                    hit harder. It’s not packed with jump scares, but it leaves you thinking about it long after it’s
                    over.</p>

                <h3>The pope's exorcist</h3>
                <p>The Pope’s Exorcist (2023) follows Father Amorth, the Vatican’s chief exorcist, as he confronts a
                    terrifying possession that uncovers a hidden Church secret.</p>
                <h3>review:      8.02/10</h3>
                <p>The Pope’s Exorcist is a tense and entertaining horror with Russell Crowe bringing a lot of
                    personality to Father Amorth. It mixes classic possession scares with a bigger mystery, so it feels
                    both creepy and adventurous. It’s not the scariest exorcism movie out there, but it’s fun, stylish,
                    and surprisingly engaging.</p>

                <h3>Until dawn</h3>
                <p>Until Dawn is a horror story where a group of friends spend the night in a remote mountain lodge,
                    only to
                    face a masked killer and terrifying creatures—forcing them to make life-or-death choices until
                    morning.</p>
                <h3>review:      5.68/10</h3>
                <p>Until Dawn feels like playing through a horror movie you control a group of friends stuck on a
                    mountain where every choice can mean life or death. It’s tense, full of twists, and the choices
                    really make you feel the pressure. It mixes slasher vibes with supernatural horror, and while some
                    parts are a bit over the top, it’s a thrilling experience that keeps you on edge.</p>

                <h3>Evil dead rise</h3>
                <p>Evil Dead Rise (2023) is a horror film where two estranged sisters must fight for survival after
                    flesh-possessing demons are unleashed in a Los Angeles apartment building.</p>
                <h3>review:      8.50/10</h3>
                <p>Evil Dead Rise is brutal, bloody, and relentless from start to finish. It takes the classic Evil Dead
                    chaos out of the cabin and into a city apartment, which makes it feel fresh but still terrifying.
                    The gore is extreme, the scares are intense, and the family dynamic adds real emotional weight. It’s
                    not for the faint of heart, but if you love hardcore horror, it delivers.</p>

                    possessed. The entity relentlessly targets them and their unborn child.</p>
                <h3>review:      7.26/10</h3>
                <p>It’s creepy and gives you that uneasy feeling, but it’s kinda slow. Some scares are predictable, but
                    the vibe is spooky and the doll is just uncomfortable to look at. Not the scariest Conjuring movie,
                    but still worth watching if you like creepy horror.

                <h3>review:      7.87/10</h3>
                <p>This one is actually scary. Way better than the first Annabelle, with real tension and creepy scenes
                    that stick with you. It still has a slow build, but the scares land harder and the overall vibe is
                    much darker. Definitely one of the stronger movies in the Conjuring universe.

                <h3>review:      6.98/10</h3>
                <p>This one feels more fun than scary. It has a bunch of creepy moments and cool ideas, but it’s less
                    intense and more like a haunted house movie. Not as scary as *Annabelle: Creation*, but still
                    entertaining and easy to watch if you like the Conjuring universe.

                    horror movies that makes you scared of the dark afterward.

                <p>Not as scary as the first one, but still creepy. It leans more into the story and explains things
                    instead of nonstop scares. Some moments are tense and unsettling, but it feels a bit slower. Still
                    good if you liked the first Insidious and want more of the story.
